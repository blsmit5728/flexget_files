#My [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget) Setup

A big thanks to [jawilson](https://github.com/jawilson) for helping me out with the config. 

There are some private portions of my config. They contain info for logins and various other things that one shouldn't need.
The new [secrets](http://flexget.com/wiki/Plugins/secrets) plugin for flexget allows me to hide these in a single file and still show everyone my config.

Of course my list of shows lives in `series.yml` and has some quality specific stuff wrapped around it. 
These will be removed in the coming weeks/months when I have time and be replaced by various [trakt.tv](http:trakt.tv) lists.
