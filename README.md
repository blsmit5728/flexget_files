#My [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget) Setup

A big thanks to [jawilson](https://github.com/jawilson) for helping me out with the config. 

There are some private portions of my config. They contain info for logins and various other things that are not needed. 

* `private/tl.yml`
* `private/email.yml`

There will be more private files as I move on. You can remove the `- include` from the config and all should be well.

Of course my list of shows lives in `series.yml` and has some quality specific stuff wrapped around it. These will be removed in the coming weeks/months when I have time and be replaced by various [trakt.tv](http:trakt.tv) lists.
